# 🦠 Global Viral Research Defense Center (In Progress)

**Incident Response:** Containing a Supply Chain Breach via C2 Command
**My Role:** Containment Director (SOC Lead)

---

## 💡 The Challenge

The **Global Viral Research Center (GVRC)** experienced a sophisticated cyber attack involving a **supply chain compromise** that led to C2 (**Command and Control**) traffic and the suspected exfiltration of sensitive research data.

The primary challenge was the speed and complexity of the attack, requiring the team to immediately activate the **Incident Response Plan (IRP)** and achieve **Containment** and **Eradication** under extreme pressure.

## 🛠️ Process & My Technical Contributions

As the **Containment Director**, my role focused on managing the initial triage, ensuring methodical data collection, and leading the containment phase according to the playbook.

### 1. Triage and Digital Forensics

* **Initial Triage:** Led the team in verifying the breach and categorizing the incident severity, which involved **rapid log analysis** to identify the initial point of compromise.
* **Evidence Collection:** Oversaw the **digital forensics** process, ensuring that critical artifacts (logs, memory dumps, disk images) were properly collected and documented before any containment actions were taken, preserving the **chain of custody**.

> **Artifacts to show:**
> Screenshot Suggestion: Include an image of your *Forensics Artifact Checklist* or the initial *Incident Triage Report*.

### 2. Containment and Eradication Strategy

* **Containment Execution:** Directed the isolation of affected systems and **segmented the network** to prevent **lateral movement** of the C2 command structure. This involved specific firewall block rules and disabling compromised accounts.
* **Eradication Plan:** Developed the step-by-step plan for eradicating the threat, ensuring all backdoors and persistence mechanisms were identified and removed before recovery. This included validating that the supply chain vulnerability that caused the initial breach was patched.

> **Deliverables to show:**
> Screenshot Suggestion: Include an image of the *Containment Phase Checklist/Playbook Steps* you followed or a visual representation of the isolation steps.

## ✅ Outcome & Impact

This ongoing project validates my ability to operate effectively as a **Security Operations Center (SOC) team lead** during a high-severity incident. My direct contribution was ensuring that the containment phase was executed cleanly and compliantly, minimizing data loss and enabling a reliable path to full recovery while adhering to established **Incident Response Playbooks**.
